# Axon-Healthcare-Analysis-Project(interactive dashboard creation using MS Excel, Power Bi & Tableau)

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze healthcare data to gain meaningful insights into patient demographics, doctor performance, treatment efficiency, and overall hospital operations.
This analysis helps healthcare administrators and stakeholders make data-driven decisions to improve patient care, manage resources efficiently, and optimize costs.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/ashwinireddy09/Axon-Healthcare-analysis-project/blob/main/Data_Healthcare_Patient_V3_.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

1.	Total Patients
- Purpose: Shows the total number of registered patients.
2.	Total Doctors
- Purpose: Displays the total number of available doctors.
3.	Total Visits
- Purpose: Number of patient visits over a given period.
4.	Average Age of Patients
- Purpose: Understand the demographics of patients.
5.	Top 5 Diagnosed Conditions
- Purpose: Identifies the most common patient conditions.
6.	Follow-Up Rate
- Purpose: Shows the percentage of visits requiring follow-ups.
7.	Treatment Cost Per Visit (Avg.)
- Purpose: Helps in financial analysis of healthcare spending.
8.	Total Lab Tests Conducted
- Purpose: Shows the volume of lab tests performed.
9.	Percentage of Abnormal Lab Results
- Purpose: Determines the rate of abnormal test results.
10.	Doctor Workload (Avg. Patients Per Doctor)
- Purpose: Measures how many patients each doctor sees on average.

## Process
- Data Collection: Collected data from Patients, Doctors, Visits, Treatments, and LabResults tables.

- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.

- Data Modeling: Built relationships using PatientID, DoctorID, and VisitID for integrated analysis.

- KPI Creation: Created key metrics using DAX and SQL for visits, costs, follow-ups, and workloads.

- Data Visualization: Developed Power BI dashboards to display insights and performance metrics.

- Insight Generation: Interpreted results to improve patient care, efficiency, and resource management.

# Insights

## Key findings from the analysis:

1. The average patient age reveals the main demographic group served by the hospital.

2. The top diagnosed conditions help prioritize healthcare resources and preventive programs.

3. A high follow-up rate may indicate chronic conditions or treatment inefficiencies.

4. Monitoring average treatment cost supports better budget allocation and cost management.

5. Doctor workload analysis ensures fair distribution of patients among doctors.

6. The percentage of abnormal lab results highlights potential areas of medical concern.
